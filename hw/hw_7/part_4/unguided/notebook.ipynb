    "<p>Peter Pan has been the companion of many children, and went a long way, starting as a Christmas play and ending up as a Disney classic. Did you know that although the play was titled \"Peter Pan, Or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\", J. M. Barrie's novel was actually titled \"Peter and Wendy\"? </p>\n",
    "<p>You're going to explore and analyze Peter Pan's text to answer the question in the instruction pane below. You are working with the text version available here at <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-h/16-h.htm\">Project Gutenberg</a>. Feel free to add as many cells as necessary. Finally, remember that you are only tested on your answer, not on the methods you use to arrive at the answer!</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't completed a DataCamp project before you should check out the <a href=\"https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/33\">Intro to Projects</a> first to learn about the interface. <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-importing-data-in-python\">Intermediate Importing Data in Python</a> and <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-natural-language-processing-in-python\">Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python</a> teach the skills required to complete this project. Should you decide to use them, English stopwords have been downloaded from <code>nltk</code> and are available for you in your environment.</p>"
